Lightweight document management system. Web api.

## Description
The web API and web interface are currently under development.

## Why?
- It is cool to have your own project.
- Practice of technologies and methodologies.
- My friends have a small business, and they are tired of looking for useful document system.
- I have a raspberry pi. I want to practice deploing .net web api under Linux.
